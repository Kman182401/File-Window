## Sync Workflow

The `bin/clone` command keeps GitHub identical to the live trading system on this workstation. It copies any external folders listed in `.clone.toml` into the repository tree, auto-commits local edits, and pushes whenever changes are detected.

Common calls:

- Preview: `clone --dry-run`
- Sync + push: `clone --push` (or just `clone`)
- Include oversized files once: `clone --allow-large --push`
- Review branch: `clone --pr --push`
- Opt out of auto-commit: `clone --no-auto-commit --force`

`.clone.toml` maps external directories (e.g., `~/orders`) into subfolders inside the repo. Global and per-source excludes keep logs/caches out of Git. A cron job runs `clone --push --scan-secrets` every 15 minutes so ChatGPT can analyze this GitHub repo and get the full, current system without needing any extra context.
