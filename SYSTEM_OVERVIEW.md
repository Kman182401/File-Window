## Data Flow

```
IBKR Gateway → Market Data Adapter → Feature Engineering → RL Models
                                                          ↓
Trade Logs ← Order Execution ← Risk Management ← Trading Decision
```

## Symbol Mapping

The system trades futures contracts as proxies:
- `ES1!` → ES futures (S&P 500 E-mini)
- `NQ1!` → NQ futures (Nasdaq 100 E-mini)
- `EURUSD` → 6E futures (CME Euro FX)
- `GBPUSD` → 6B futures (CME British Pound)
- `AUDUSD` → 6A futures (CME Australian Dollar)
- `XAUUSD` → GC futures (COMEX Gold)

## Environment Variables

```bash
export IBKR_HOST="127.0.0.1"      # IB Gateway host
export IBKR_PORT="4002"           # 4002 for paper, 4001 for live
export IBKR_CLIENT_ID="9002"      # Unique client ID
export ENABLE_ORDER_EXEC="1"      # Enable order execution
export DRY_RUN="0"                # 0 for real orders, 1 for simulation
export ALLOW_ORDERS="1"           # Master switch for orders
```
